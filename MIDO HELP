CHECKS TO COMPLETE FOR A NEW PROJECT

1. Check the orgs/dev.json file and update the template value to the latest trialforce template ID you want to use.
2. Update the API Version for CumulusCI and SalesforceDX by checking the following files. 
    NOTE: Make sure its the latest supported version for CumulusCI which is typically the latest version - 1
    NOTE: ALL Updates MUST match to be the same version number!
    NOTE: This update MUST be done before you retrieve ANY metadata.
    - sfdx-project.json - Update the sourceApiVersion entry
    - In terminal run sfdx force:config:set apiVersion=50.0 (Replacing 50.0 with the version number you are using)
    - cumulusci.yml - Update the api_version noted at the top of the project.
3. Update the repo_url value in the cumulusci.yml file to match the location of the MIDO package. This should be in the SFDO-SE organisation on GitHub.
4. Perform a Find and Replace for all references of "IDO-MIDO-TEMPLATE", replacing it with the name of your MIDO Package.

MIDO PACK FOR LOCALISATION?

1. Update the locale values in the config_user_locale task within the CumulusCI.yml file. 
    - TimeZoneSidKey - Reference list here: https://www.salesforceben.com/list-timezonesidkey-salesforce/
    - LanguageLocaleKey - Reference list here: https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=admin_supported_locales.htm&type=0 copy the locale code. i.e. English (Belize) would be the code en_BZ
    - LocaleSidKey - Same as LanguageLocaleKey
